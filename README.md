# 🛍️ Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind Practice E-Commerce App

This project is a **frontend e-commerce website** built as a practice exercise to learn and apply:

- **Next.js** (App Router)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**

It serves as a showcase of my understanding of modern frontend development, component structuring, and responsive design using the latest React-based stack.

## 🔧 Features

- ⚛️ Built with **Next.js** using the **App Router**

> ⚠️ **Note:** This is a frontend-only project — no backend functionality is implemented. Cart, product interactions, and forms are **not wired up**. Components are hardcoded to simulate UI structure and flow.

## 📚 Purpose

This project was created as part of my personal learning journey into full-stack development. The goal was to gain confidence working with the Next.js framework, static site generation, component-based architecture, and styling using utility-first CSS with Tailwind.

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Add real product data and functionality
- Implement a backend with API integration
- Enable interactive cart and form submissions
- Add authentication and user flow
